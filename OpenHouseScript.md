## Ngee Ann Polytechnic Engineering Science Final Year Project with MooVita, 2020
### Open House Video Script

In our final year, we developed a virtual autonomous vehicle test platform based around the Robot Operating System ecosystem, under the mentorship of MooVita, a self-driving technology company based in NP.

We designed a kinematically accurate vehicle model, physics, virtual sensors, and a series of fundamental algorithms for self-driving from the ground up, allowing anyone to test their ideas in an adaptive, highly configurable environment without the risk and cost of practical testing.
